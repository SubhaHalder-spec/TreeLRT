# TreeLRT
Testing against tree-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA Code is for testing equality means against tree-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA. We have considered the Likelihood ratio test of H_0: mu_0 = mu_1 = ... = mu_k vs. H_1: mu_0 <= mu_i (at least one strict inequality), for all i >= 1, where mu_0 and mu_i represent the population means of the control and with treatment.  The input has two variables: a sample_data list and a significance_level. The output includes the critical value, the LRT test statistic value, and the result, indicating whether or not the null hypothesis will be rejected. If the value of the test statistic is less than the critical value, we will reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we will not reject it.
