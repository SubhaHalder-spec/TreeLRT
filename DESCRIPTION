Description: This package gives a likelihood ratio test for testing equality of means against tree-ordered alternatives in one-way ANOVA. Here we considered a hypothesis testing of H_0:mu_0 = mu_1 = ... = mu_k vs H_1:mu_0 <= mu_i (with at least one strict inequality), for all i greater than or equal to 1, where mu_0 and mu_i represent the population mean of the control and i-th treatment, respectively. The input comprises two variables: sample_data and significance_level. The output includes the critical value, the LRT statistic value, and the outcome, which shows whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.  If the value of the test statistic less than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, do not reject.
Usage: TreeLRT(sample_data, significance_level)
Arguments: The data should be organised in the form of a list, namely in the format list(a, b, c, ...), where a represents the control treatment and the others (b, c, ...) represent data vectors of different normal independent treatments. The significance level, represented by values such as 0.05 or 0.01, denotes the predetermined threshold of significance for this test.
